## Working Paper

**Bank Interest Rate Risk Exposures and Municipal Bond Yields**
<br>
With Jinoug Jeung, Abinash Pati
<br>
<font size=2><p style="line-height: 1.2;"><p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This paper examines how commercial banks, as marginal investors in the bank-qualified municipal bond market, transmit interest rate risk exposures to bond yields. Preferential tax treatment incentivizes state-specific bank holdings, segmenting marginal investors across states and creating cross-state and temporal variation in exposures. We find that heightened exposures, measured by earnings-based income gaps, raise yields, with effects amplifying during monetary tightening---especially unexpected rate hikes. Deposit market power and derivatives hedging attenuate transmission. Comparisons with valuation-based repricing/maturity gaps reveal regime-specific channels: earnings risks dominate in tightening regimes, valuation risks in easing ones. Results highlight intermediary risk spillovers, with implications for local government financing.</p></p></font>

**Direction is more important than speed: A comparison of direction and value prediction of stock returns**
<br>
With Tingting Cheng, Albert Bo Zhao

_Presented at Shanghai Jiao Tong University ACEM, South China University of Technology (The 21st Chinese Finance Annual Meeting)_
<br>
<font size=2><p style="line-height: 1.2;"><p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">A major research task in asset pricing is predicting the value of future stock returns. We examine a seemingly simpler and yet less explored task—predicting the direction of future stock returns. Theoretically, a simple model in Christoffersen and Diebold (2006) suggests that direction prediction is closely related to the widely recognized volatility clustering effect. Empirically, we compare the direction and value prediction of the S&P500 excess returns via a variety of models, including linear, regularized linear, machine learning, and combination methods. The general findings indicate that for a typical investor, direction prediction generates greater economic gains than value prediction does because of the information embedded in volatility and higher moments of returns. From the models’ perspectives, while machine learning and combination methods can enhance both direction and value prediction, the enhancement is more significant in the realm of direction prediction, and the predictive power stems from the volatility mechanism. Additional analyses suggest that value and direction prediction share similar stock market risk factors.</p></p></font>
