## Working Paper

**Bank Interest Rate Risk Exposures and Municipal Bond Yields**
<br>
With Jinoug Jeung, Abinash Pati
<br>
<font size=2><p style="line-height: 1.2;"><p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This paper examines how commercial banks, as marginal investors in the bank-qualified municipal bond market, transmit interest rate risk exposures to bond yields. Preferential tax treatment incentivizes state-specific bank holdings, segmenting marginal investors across states and creating cross-state and temporal variation in exposures. We find that heightened exposures, measured by earnings-based income gaps, raise yields, with effects amplifying during monetary tightening---especially unexpected rate hikes. Deposit market power and derivatives hedging attenuate transmission. Comparisons with valuation-based repricing/maturity gaps reveal regime-specific channels: earnings risks dominate in tightening regimes, valuation risks in easing ones. Results highlight intermediary risk spillovers, with implications for local government financing.</p></p></font>

**Firm-Level Idiosyncratic Uncertainty: Measurement and Effect**
<br>
<font size=2><p style="line-height: 1.2;"><p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">This paper measures firm-level idiosyncratic uncertainty by adapting the econometric approach of Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng (2015) and quantifies its economic effects. Firm-level idiosyncratic uncertainty exhibits substantial heterogeneity across firm size, age, and other characteristics, and differs from typical proxies in the literature. Using local projections, we show that heightened idiosyncratic uncertainty significantly reduces physical capital investment, increases cash holdings, and lowers leverage. Fixed-effects regressions further show that greater idiosyncratic uncertainty is associated with significantly larger managerial EPS forecast errors. This study provides micro-level evidence that firm-specific uncertainty affects corporate decisions and information disclosure behavior.</p></p></font>
